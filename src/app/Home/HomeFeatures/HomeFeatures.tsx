            ButteryAI is always making sure those connected to the Hive are communicating against known sources-of-truth
            and evaluating their trustworthiness. This gives greater control and security for the ButteryAI platform.
            Enterprise customers get even deeper control through customizing the sources-of-truth ButteryAI uses for
            their Hive.
